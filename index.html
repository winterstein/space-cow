<h1>The Adventures of Space Cow</h1>

<p>J liked to watch the skies. He liked to see the moon as she shrank (<em>waned</em> as the 
astronomers say) and grew 
(<em>waxed</em> as the astronomers say, though they don't say <em>who</em> waxed the moon, &amp;
waxing other things like lemons &amp; cars does not make them grow).
He liked to see rainbows, when the rain drops slice the sunlight into many colours.
Most of all he liked to spot shotting stars (<em>meteors</em>) which blaze across the night sky.
Like this:   </p>

<p>Sometimes J would see a meteor show -- a whole group of meteors like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>--->+ --->+ --->+</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One night he saw a special meteor that went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-8->+</p>
</blockquote>

<p>J had seen lots of meteors but they all flew straight. He'd never seen one before that looped the loop.
It seemed to come down close by, just over the hill behind his house.</p>

<p>So he pulled on his coat &amp; his boots &amp; went to investigate.</p>

<p>He climbed up the hill &amp; saw the most incredible thing.
There was a pale flying saucer, the size of a large car, which shimmered in the moonlight. It stood a metre off the ground on thick stubby metal legs.
A door was open in it's side &amp; aramp led down to the ground.
In front of the flying saucer &amp; the globe was a cow.</p>

<p>But not like any cow J had ever seen before.</p>

<p>This cow was blue &amp; green. She was eating the grass (which is the normal for cows) &amp;
&amp; wearing several electronic gadgets &amp; singing to herself (which is not).</p>

<p>J came closer &amp; this is what the cow sang:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The grass you grow here is lovely, <br />
  Your meadows are a wonderful laugh, <br />
  I wish I could stay &amp; chew the cud, <br />
  But for me it's the starry path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then she stopped singing and chewed in silence for a minute. After which she spoke.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;Third planet. The grass has a rich taste with a summery tang.
There are after-tastes of smoke and industrial flavours.>></p>

<p>The cow suddenly left off talking, and stared straight at J.   </p>

<p>"Moo," said the cow, "moo moo." <br />
J asked "What kind of a cow are you? Who were you talking to just now about the grass?" <br />
"Moo." repeated the cow. <br />
"Cow's don't actually say 'moo', they just moo." said J, "It's different." <br />
"Blast." said the cow, "I can't get the accent right." <br />
Then she smiled and said "Hello Earth Child. I am Space Cow, interstellar food critic, &amp; I travel the stars
tasting the grass of different planets." <br />
"I write a guide book you know. It's read by many grass-eaters across the Milky Way."   </p>

<p>J nodded thoughtfully. Adults often say things that make little sense. A thoughtful nod seems to please them. <br />
"What is the big ball?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That is my planet of course." the cow replied.
"I get terribly homesick when I'm away from my planet, so I take it with me." <br />
"Your planet is very small." J observed. <br />
The cow gave a reproachful moo and drew her feet together in a stand-offish manner.
J feared he had offended her.</p>

<p>"It may be small," said the cow, "But I take very good care of it. Better care than you take of your planet."   </p>

<p>J did not want to offend Space Cow, so he hastily added "It does look levely. Especially the river."</p>

<p>Although the planet was no bigger than a normal house, it had a miniature river which ran through a lush grassy meadow
("a continent, please" said Space Cow) down to the lake ("the sea" corrected Space Cow) that covered nearly half the planet.
There was a small puff of water from the sea, and J spotted a little whale, no bigger than a trout, that had just spouted. The
whale rolled lazily over to look at J, winked one tiny eye, and then dove beneath the water.</p>

<p>"That is the Bonsai Whale." the cow explained, "I picked him up from the ocean ponds of Alpha Centauri."</p>

<p>The Bonsai Whale surfaced again. He sang in a deep rich voice:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Life on the Ocean Wave <br />
  A life on the ocean wave, <br />
  A-home on the rolling deep! <br />
  Oh its the salty brine I crave
  Where the great sea turtles sleep</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Or Lobster Quadrille)</p>

<p>"Hm" said Space Cow with a distant look in her eye, adding a thoughtful "Well." Then she chewed some grass. Finally she said
"You must be a local."</p>

<p>"Yes." said J. He lived just over the hill which was about as local as you could get.   </p>

<p>"Good." said Space Cow, "Then as a local of the planet, you can help me find the best grass on this planet."   </p>

<h2>Parents</h2>

<p>"We'll travel in my spaceship." Space Cow continued, taking J's agreement for granted. "Do your parents know where you are?"</p>

<p>"No" said J.</p>

<p>So they went back to J's house. Space Cow knocked on the door with one hoof. J's mum answered the door. She looked at the alien cow in surprise.</p>

<p>"I am Space Cow," said Space Cow, "And I am kidnapping your son for the evening."   </p>

<p>J's mum continued to look surprised.</p>

<p>"There." Space Cow smiled, "Come along J." and she trotted off to the spaceship.</p>

<p>The spaceship was round and silver. Space Cow and J trotted up the ramp. Inside there were no seats, but there was fresh hay
on the floor, and a bale of hay which J sat down on.</p>

<p>The door closed. Space Cow mooed softly to herself and pushed a couple of buttons. 
The spaceship rocked to the left, and it rocked to the right. Then it took off in a blaze of light. With a magnificent WHOOOSH! the spaceship
flew up into the air. Up up high they went. J could see the whole town spread out below them. The lights of town twinkled in the dusk.</p>

<p>"Where has good grass on this planet?" Space Cow asked.</p>

<p>Where had grass? J thought. "The school football pitch" he said.</p>

<p>"Computer." said Space Cow, "Take us to the school football pitch!"</p>

<p>The spaceship dipped and flew down to earth. It hovered over the school. The silver legs came out and the spaceship touched down lightly
on the football pitch. Space Cow's planet also landed with a soft thump.</p>

<p>Space Cow and J walked out onto the football pitch. It was evening &amp; there was no-one around. 
Space Cow ate a patch of grass, mooing contentedly.</p>

<p>"Not bad grass." said Space Cow, "Though it tastes a lot like the grass by your house."</p>

<p>They went back into the spaceship. "Where next?" asked Space Cow.</p>

<p>Where else had grass? J thought. "My grandparent's garden." he said.</p>

<p>"Computer." said Space Cow, "Take us to his grandparent's garden!"</p>

<p>As they came down to land, J said "Careful -- don't mess up Grandma's flower beds."</p>

<p>Space Cow said the flowers looked delicious, but she would stay on the grass. She chewed a few mouthfuls thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Nice grass." said Space Cow as they went back into the spaceship, "Though it <em>also</em> tastes a lot like the grass by your house and the grass at the school."</p>

<p>The noise of the spaceship disturbed Grandpa, who had been doing a crossword puzzle. 
He went to the window and drew the curtain -- just in time to see Space Cow trotting up the
ramp into her spaceship.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Grandpa, "I've never seen an alien before. And in our garden!"</p>

<p>"I hope it didn't mess up the pansies." said Grandma.</p>

<p>"That was all nice grass, but it all tasted the same." said Space Cow.</p>

<p>"It's grass. What else would grass taste like?" J asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots of things!" said Space Cow, "On my planet, we have plain grass, &amp; banana flavoured grass."</p>

<p>"But let me show you a really interesting grass..."</p>

<p>She pushed a lever. The spaceship rocked to the left, and it rocked to the right. Then it took off in a blaze of light. With a magnificent WHOOOSH! the spaceship
flew up into the air. Up up high they went -- and they kept on going. Up, up into space. The whole planet lay below them like a beautiful marble.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" J asked.</p>

<p>"To the Tau Ceti star," said Space Cow, "There's a planet there where they grow chocolate-fudge grass."</p>

<p>Faster &amp; faster went the spaceship, and in a just a few minutes they had reached the planet of Tau Ceti Prime.</p>

<p>They touched down at a very moden looking barn. A Tau Ceti cow came out to meet them. This cow was green &amp; orange. 
"Moo!" said the Tau Ceti cow in a friendly way.</p>

<p>Space Cow pointed at the grass around them. "This" she said, "is the fammous chocolate-fudge grass of Tau-Ceti." She chewed a bit. "Delicious!" she said.</p>

<p>J tried to eat a handful of grass. It did taste a bit chocalety, but mostly it tasted of grass. He couldn't eat it. "Fooey!" he said.</p>

<p>Space Cow gave a thoughtful moo. "Seeing as you're a child, you might do better with some milk from this grass." she said. 
Space Cow bustled about the spaceship &amp; produced a small bowl-like object. <br />
"This should do for a cup," she said. "It's a spare cap for the fuel tank, but I assure you it's clean." </p>

<p>The Tau-Ceti cow took the cup &amp; brought it back full of milk.</p>

<p>J drank some. It tasted just like chocolate fudge brownies.</p>

<p>Then it was time to go home. They got back into the spaceship &amp; Space Cow flew it back, dropping J off at his house. 
His mum &amp; dad gave him a big hug. </p>

<p>The next moring J wondered if it had all been a dream. He had breakfast as usual. He went into school as usual.</p>

<p>There was a big dent in the playing field though. Such as might be made by a small but well cared for planet.</p>
